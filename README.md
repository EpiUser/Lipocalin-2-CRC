# Lipocalin-2-CRC
These files include codes that were used for the analysis presented in the manuscript "Sex- and site-specific associations of lipocalin 2 and incident colorectal cancer: Results from the EPIC cohort".
Multiple macros were used to facilitate analysis; therefore, users are advised to remember running the macros before using the codes for analysis. 
Both SAS and R were used during analysis; therefore, users are advised to pay attention to the software and package used. Installation of R packages are required before running R codes. 
Codes were simplified to a lesser extend and some details not required were removed from the original code. 
Questions can be directed to the corresponding Author.
